What kind of images to use
	•	Vector graphics or illustrations with clear, flat colors.
	•	The image can be complex, but colors should be solid and distinct, without gradients, shadows, or fades.
	•	Supported formats: PNG or JPG.
	•	Examples: logos, icons, comics, or colorful vector drawings with separate solid color areas.

⸻

The script separates each dominant color of the image into its own layer, allowing you to view and use each color region individually.
