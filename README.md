How to use

You can run the script either in Google Colab or locally on your computer.
You can use this image as an example:
<img width="1300" height="1300" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f5ef8df7-022f-48f7-828f-e3fb8df165be" />


In Google Colab
	1.	Open the notebook and click Run all.
	2.	When the message “Upload PNG/JPG” appears, select your image.
	3.	The program will analyze the image and display:
	•	the original image
	•	and separate layers, each showing one flat color.
	4.	All layers are saved automatically in the folder panels_out/.

Locally
	1.	Open the Python file in your IDE or terminal.
	2.	Run the script and select a PNG or JPG image when prompted.
	3.	The output images will be created in the panels_out/ folder.

⸻

What kind of images to use
	•	Vector graphics or illustrations with clear, flat colors.
	•	The image can be complex, but colors should be solid and distinct, without gradients, shadows, or fades.
	•	Supported formats: PNG or JPG.
	•	Examples: logos, icons, comics, or colorful vector drawings with separate solid color areas.

⸻

The script separates each dominant color of the image into its own layer, allowing you to view and use each color region individually.
